Welcome to the **revealjs_cv** tutorial! This comprehensive guide will walk you through creating a stunning, interactive CV website using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your web development skills, this tutorial covers everything you need to know‚Äîfrom setting up your development environment to deploying your site on the cloud.



## Introduction

Creating a personal CV website is an excellent way to showcase your skills, projects, and accomplishments. By leveraging **Reveal.js**, a powerful framework for creating presentations, you can craft an interactive and visually appealing online CV. Hosting your site with **GitHub Pages** ensures it's easily accessible and version-controlled.

This tutorial is designed to guide you through each step of the process, providing detailed instructions and insights to help you build a professional CV website.


## Getting Started

### 1. Creating a GitHub Repository üõ†Ô∏è

Before cloning the repository, you need to create one on GitHub.

1. **Log in to GitHub**.
2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
   - **Repository Name**: `yourusername.github.io` *(Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username)*
   - **Privacy**: Choose **Public**.
   - **Initialize with a README**: no.
3. **Create Repository**: Click **"Create repository"**.

### 2. Cloning the Repository üìÇ

Clone the `revealjs_cv` repository, which contains the template and necessary files for your CV website.

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/lundechen/revealjs_cv.git
cd revealjs_cv
```

Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you just created:

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
```

*Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.*

### 3. Installing Live Server or Live Preview Extension üîå

To preview your website in real-time, install the Live Server or Live Preview extension in VSCode.

1. **Open VSCode**.
2. **Navigate to Extensions**: Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar.
3. **Search for "Live Server" or "Live Preview"**.
4. **Install the Extension**.

*Alternatively, use the command line:*

```bash
code --install-extension ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

#### Using Live Server

- Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer sidebar.
- Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
- **View in Browser**: A new browser tab will open, displaying your CV website. Any edits saved in VSCode (e.g. `index.html`) will automatically refresh in the browser.



## Version Control with Git üê±‚Äçüíª

Version control is crucial for tracking changes and collaborating efficiently. Git, combined with Gitee/GitHub, offers a robust solution for managing your project.


### 1. Committing Changes üìù

*Verify the initialization:*

```bash
git status
```

You should see the untracked files listed.


Start tracking your project files and commit your initial setup.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Setup revealjs_cv template"
```

- **`git add .`**: Stages all files in the current directory.
- **`git commit -m "..."`**: Commits the staged files with a descriptive message.

### 2. Pushing to GitHub üöÄ

To host your repository on GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, follow these steps.

#### Linking Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git
```

*Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.*

> **Note:** Using SSH URLs (`git@github.com:...`) enables passwordless authentication once SSH keys are set up.

#### Pushing Your Code

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

- **`-u`**: Sets the upstream branch.
- **`origin`**: The remote repository.
- **`master`**: The branch name.


## Setting Up GitHub Pages üåê

GitHub Pages allows you to host your website directly from your GitHub repository. Follow these steps to deploy your CV website.

### 1. Configuring GitHub Pages

1. **Navigate to Your Repository on GitHub**.
2. **Access Settings**:
   - Click on the **"Settings"** tab.
3. **Select GitHub Pages**:
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Pages"**.
4. **Configure Source**:
   - Under **"Source"**, select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `master`).
   - Choose the root folder (`/`) if your `index.html` is in the root directory.
5. **Save**:
   - Click **"Save"** to apply the settings.

> **Note:** Deployment may take a few minutes. Once done, GitHub Pages will provide a URL to access your website.

*Example URL:*

```
https://yourusername.github.io/
```

*Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username.*


## Advanced Deployment with Docker üê≥

For those interested in deploying their CV website using Docker, you have the flexibility to choose between a **Dockerfile** or **Docker Compose**. This section provides guidance on both methods to enhance your learning experience.

### 1. Dockerizing Your Application

Docker allows you to containerize your application, ensuring consistency across environments.

#### Option 1: Using a Dockerfile

1. **Ensure your `Dockerfile` is set up as shown:**

    `````Dockerfile:Dockerfile
    FROM nginx:latest
    COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html/
    `````

2. **Build and Run the Docker Image**

    ```bash
    sudo docker build -t revealjs_cv .
    sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 revealjs_cv
    ```

    - **`-t revealjs_cv`**: Tags the image with the name `revealjs_cv`.
    - **`-d`**: Runs the container in detached mode.
    - **`-p 80:80`**: Maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container.

3. **Access Your CV Website**: Navigate to `http://localhost` in your browser.

#### Option 2: Using Docker Compose

1. **Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` is set up as shown:**

    `````yaml:docker-compose.yml
    version: '3'
    services:
      my-great-nginx-web-server:
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
          - '80:80'
        volumes:
          - type: bind
            source: ./
            target: /usr/share/nginx/html/
        restart: always
    `````

2. **Build and Run with Docker Compose**

    ```bash
    sudo docker-compose up -d
    ```

    - **`-d`**: Runs the containers in detached mode.

3. **Access Your CV Website**: Navigate to `http://localhost` in your browser.

### 2. Deploying to a Cloud VM ‚òÅÔ∏è

Deploy your Dockerized application to a cloud service provider like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), or Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, etc.

#### Steps Overview

1. **Provision a VM Instance**: Choose your preferred cloud provider and create a new virtual machine.
2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure both are installed on your VM.
3. **Transfer Your Project Files**: Use `scp` or Git to transfer your project to the VM. Or, alternatively, you can git clone the repository to the VM.
4. **Build and Run Docker Containers**: Execute the same Docker commands on the VM.
5. **Configure Firewall and DNS**: Open necessary ports and (optionally) configure a custom domain (e.g. http://lunde.top).
